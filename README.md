## Overview:
        This program was made for a video game design course at Virginia Tech.
        The purpose of this code is a study of 3D rendering, where a wireframe table is rendered using p5 Javascript libraries.
        Note that the specific techniques used in the implmentation of this project were a requirement of the assignment.

## About the program:
        Using the mouse, clicking on the canvas and dragging will rotate the table.
        The different faces are colored differently as to show the user how the table is moving in three dimensional space.
